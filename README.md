## Introduction To Setting Up a Website

This was an introduction to setting up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Git and Github through UCSD.

- This helps me learn the basics of setting up and getting introduced to the process of web development.
- I learned how to utilize github with already some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
